##Some basic and (maybe) advanced code in Python

All these exercises have been picked from exercism.io (great site, by the way)

###clock.py
Here I hoped to implement something such that a clock would keep running as it does here, and alongside if the user ever presses 1 or 2 or 3, then do the corresponding action as mentioned. I have not been able to do the latter part. It just runs continuously showing the time by refreshing again and again on the the same line. I also want it to change, that, increase and decrease a minute as the user types 1 or 2 *dynamically*. Maybe I will work on that soon.

###pangram.py
A simple program to ouput 'Pangram' if the input contains all letters of the alphabet at least once; else output 'Not Pangram'.

###rna_transcription.py
This is a simple program to print out the, sort of, compliment of a DNA strand. A DNA strand contains G, C, T, A. It compliments are: C, G, A, U respectively. Just do that. Simple. The input is a string of characters: 'G', 'C', 'T', 'A'.

###dna_hamming.py
This is a program to compare 2 DNA strands, input as explained above, and then count the number of characters which are different.
